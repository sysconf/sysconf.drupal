# Gitted: Import/export machine sate through git push/pull

Gitted solves 2 problems:

* website software *installation* (for example, a CMS like Drupal) can
  be complex to install and configure, because of the dependencies
  that are needed on the system ;

* website *state* (for example, MySQL data) is difficult to manage:
  doing simple database dumps are often not enough, if it needs file
  uploads, applicative plugins, etc.

To address these issues, Gitted helps you manage the website
software *and* the changing data as one unique thing, which is stored
as a GIT repository.
